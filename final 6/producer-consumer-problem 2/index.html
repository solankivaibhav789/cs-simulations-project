        <h3 align="center">PRODUCER CONSUMER PROBLEM</h3>
        
		<!-- theory-->
<p>producer consumer problem, which is also called <b>producer consumer problem</b>, is one of the classic problems of synchronization. Let's start by understanding the problem here, before moving on to the solution and program code.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What is the Problem Statement?</h2>
<p>There is a buffer of <code>n</code> slots and each slot is capable of storing one unit of data. There are two processes running, namely, <b>producer</b> and <b>consumer</b>, which are operating on the buffer.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="bounded-buffer-problem.png" alt="Bounded Buffer Problem" /></p>
<p class="center"><b>Producer consumer problem</b></p>
<br>
<p>A producer tries to insert data into an empty slot of the buffer. A consumer tries to remove data from a filled slot in the buffer. As you might have guessed by now, those two processes won't produce the expected output if they are being executed concurrently. </p>
<p>There needs to be a way to make the producer and consumer work in an independent manner.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Here's a Solution</h2>
<p>One solution of this problem is to use semaphores. The semaphores which will be used here are:</p>
<ul class="content">
<li><code>m</code>, a <b>binary semaphore</b> which is used to acquire and release the lock.</li>
<li><code>empty</code>, a <b>counting semaphore</b> whose initial value is the number of slots in the buffer, since, initially all slots are empty.</li>
<li><code>full</code>, a <b>counting semaphore</b> whose initial value is <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At any instant, the current value of empty represents the number of empty slots in the buffer and full represents the number of occupied slots in the buffer. </p>
<div><p class="center hide-on-large">
</p></div>
<hr />
<h2>The Producer Operation</h2>
<p>The pseudocode of the producer function looks like this:</p>
<pre class="c"><code class="language-clike">do 
{
    // wait until empty > 0 and then decrement 'empty'
    wait(empty);   
    // acquire lock
    wait(mutex);  
    
    /* perform the insert operation in a slot */
    
    // release lock
    signal(mutex);  
    // increment 'full'
    signal(full);   
} 
while(TRUE)</code></pre>
<ul class="content">
<li>Looking at the above code for a producer, we can see that a producer first waits until there is atleast one empty slot. </li>
<li>Then it decrements the <b>empty</b> semaphore because, there will now be one less empty slot, since the producer is going to insert data in one of those slots. </li>
<li>Then, it acquires lock on the buffer, so that the consumer cannot access the buffer until producer completes its operation.</li>
<li>After performing the insert operation, the lock is released and the value of <b>full</b> is incremented because the producer has just filled a slot in the buffer.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>The Consumer Operation</h2>
<p>The pseudocode for the consumer function looks like this:</p>
<pre class="c"><code class="language-clike">do 
{
    // wait until full > 0 and then decrement 'full'
    wait(full);
    // acquire the lock
    wait(mutex);  
    
    /* perform the remove operation in a slot */ 
    
    // release the lock
    signal(mutex); 
    // increment 'empty'
    signal(empty); 
} 
while(TRUE);</code></pre>
<ul class="content">
<li>The consumer waits until there is atleast one full slot in the buffer. </li>
<li>Then it decrements the <b>full</b> semaphore because the number of occupied slots will be decreased by one, after the consumer completes its operation.</li>
<li>After that, the consumer acquires lock on the buffer.</li>
<li>Following that, the consumer completes the removal operation so that the data from one of the full slots is removed.</li>
<li>Then, the consumer releases the lock.</li>
<li>Finally, the <b>empty</b> semaphore is incremented by 1, because the consumer has just removed data from an occupied slot, thus making it empty.</li>
</ul>
